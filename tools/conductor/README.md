# The conductor

A Node program that takes approved plans off a queue and runs them to a merged `main` with no owner
action in between, in up to two git worktree lanes. For each plan it opens a lane, starts one fresh
headless `claude -p` session per contiguous same-owner run of phases, after a read-only readiness
check of the plan, checks each session's claim
against `git`, merges `main` into the lane and runs its own gate, starts a fresh headless `architect`
session that reviews the plan and a second one that closes it on the branch, fast-forwards `main`, and
removes the lane.

**It never pushes.** Everything it does stays on this machine until you read what happened and push.

**Anything it cannot decide parks the plan**, and the lane moves on to the next plan. That covers a
`human` phase, a plan's own stop condition, a gate still red after its one repair session, a review
still failing after two fix rounds,
a spend cap, a usage limit too far off to wait for, or a session whose claim `git` does not bear out.

**`run` stays up until you pause it** (ADR-0250). A lane with nothing to start looks again every
minute, re-reading `queue.json`, and a park whose condition the tree now shows settled resumes itself
(`## Acting on a park` lists which). One `run` per working period is the intended use;
`run --until-idle` ends once no lane can move, as every run used to.

The decision and its rejected alternatives are ADR-0205. The plan that built it is Plan 0187.

## Before the first run

1. **Write `tools/conductor/local.json`.** Copy `local.example.json` and set your own figures. The
   file is gitignored, and the conductor refuses to start without it, because it carries no default
   spend.

   ```json
   { "budget_usd": { "readiness": 2, "implement": 8, "fix": 4, "review": 6, "close": 5, "merge": 3, "repair": 4 }, "run_budget_usd": 150, "max_open_worktrees": 3 }
   ```

   `run_budget_usd` is the ceiling on one run's total spend. A resident run spends while nobody is
   looking, so reaching it pauses the run: the plans in flight finish and no other starts.
   Every session gets its step's figure as `--max-budget-usd`. **The cap is checked between turns**,
   so a step can overrun it by one turn's cost (see `spike/README.md`). Optionally,
   `"model": { "implement": "opus", "fix": "opus", "review": "opus" }` picks the model per step. When
   `model` is absent, sessions use your own default.
2. **Check the queue.** `queue.json` is committed, and the architect owns its sequencing: an ordered
   plan list per lane, an optional `after` list of plans that must merge first, and optional
   `add_dirs` for a plan that reads outside the repository. A queued plan must read
   `Status: approved`.

   ```json
   { "lanes": { "a": ["0175", "0185"], "b": [] }, "plans": { "0181": { "after": ["0185"] } } }
   ```

   The file is accumulate-only and **stands on its own** (ADR-0220): a plan it still lists whose file
   has moved to `docs/plans/done/` is merged, and every command that reads the queue skips it with a
   notice rather than refusing to start. That holds on a fresh clone and after a wiped `state/`,
   because the judgement is the plan file's location and not the gitignored run record. `prune` is
   what takes the entry off the list.
3. **Run the preflight:** `node tools/conductor/conductor.mjs check`. It refuses when `local.json` is
   missing, when `queue.json` names a plan that is not approved or depends on a plan it cannot reach,
   or when `claude --version` is not a version the conductor was verified on and not a patch above one.
   A patch above one passes with a warning.
4. **Leave the main checkout alone while a run is live.** Work in a lane of your own. A fast-forward
   refuses a dirty main checkout, so work in progress there parks every close.

## Commands

All of them run from the main checkout.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `run [--lane a\|b] [--once \| --until-idle]` | Runs the queue: both lanes, or one, until `pause`, `abort` or Ctrl+C. `--until-idle` ends the run once no lane can move; `--once` stops a lane after one plan. A second conductor is refused while one runs. |
| `status` | Per lane: the plan, the step, the time in it, the spend so far. Then every parked plan with its reason, and whether the repository has already settled it. Regenerates the digest and ends with its path. |
| `digest [--history]` | Rewrites `digest.md`. `--history` writes the per-run account to `digest-history.md` instead, and is the only thing that ever writes that file. |
| `resume NNNN` | Queues a parked plan again. Refused while the park's reason still holds, e.g. a `human` phase the plan's log does not yet mark done. While a run is live, it leaves the resume for that run, which takes it on its next look. |
| `park NNNN` | Parks a plan that has not merged, with an inbox entry. |
| `finding NNNN [<ref> --done\|--wontfix\|--filed <reason>]` | With no verb, lists that plan's closing verdict with an index per finding. With one, records your disposition against the finding `<ref>` names, and the digest stops carrying it. |
| `adopt-close NNNN` | Records the close a lane already carries, when a session committed one and then lost its outcome. Verifies the branch first and writes nothing unless it passes. |
| `pause [--off]` | Asks the live run to finish the plan in flight and start no further one, and prints what it is now waiting for. `--off` cancels the ask. |
| `abort` | Stops a running conductor and every session under it. Steps in flight run again on the next `run`. |
| `prune` | Drops every merged plan from `queue.json`'s lane lists, prints each one, and rewrites nothing when there is none. Refused while a run is live. Commit the result. |
| `check` | The preflight alone. |

Ctrl+C on `run` does the same as `abort`.

**`pause` is the stop that loses nothing** (ADR-0219). `abort` and Ctrl+C kill every session under the
conductor, so a step in flight re-runs from scratch next time and its spend is gone; `pause` lets each
lane reach a *merged* plan first, which is the state at which the machine is genuinely free. The ask is
read between plans, so the wait is the rest of the plan in flight — a fix round and a suite, when one
has just started. `pause` prints the plan and step each lane is on and how long it has been there, so
that wait is legible before you decide to `abort` instead. **A pause does not outlive its run:** it is
cleared when the run ends, a `run` that finds one left behind by a dead conductor clears it and says
so, and there is therefore no way to say "start nothing tomorrow" — the answer to that is not to start
a run. **A pause is also how a resident run ordinarily ends**, and a spent `run_budget_usd` or a
refused CLI version pauses it the same way; the run record names which. A paused lane records `paused` against every plan it did not start, which the history page's
**Not started** section reads apart from `--once` and from a queue that ran out.

**A run whose own code changed on disk pauses too.** `run` is one Node process that loads its modules
once — `conductor.mjs`, `with-lock.mjs` and every `lib/*.mjs` — so a conductor change merged while it
is up does not reach it. At start it records a content hash of those files in
`state/conductor.sources.json`, compares on every look, and when they differ prints one line naming
the changed files and pauses the same way: the plans in flight finish and no other starts. **It never
restarts itself and never stops a session**; start `run` again once it ends. `status`, `resume` and
`park` read the same record and print a `notice:` line when the live run is stale, because a live run
is what takes a resume ask, and a refusal from old code otherwise reads as a real one. The comparison
is by content, not timestamp, so a checkout that puts back identical bytes is not a change.

`run` prints one line per milestone as it happens, each one `HH:MM NNNN <what>`. A line indented
under a plan number happened inside a step or a gate:

```text

```

- **Steps:** a start line with the phase range or round and the owner skill, and an end line with the
  outcome or park reason, the duration, the spend and the turns. Spend arrives only at the end: the
  CLI reports no running cost inside a session.
- **Inside a session:** each commit as it lands, each phase its log row marks done, each `cargo
  nextest`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy` or `cargo doc` call starting and ending with its counts or
  failing tests, every change in the 5-hour or 7-day usage window, and every denied command. A commit
  and a phase line carry **how long since the previous phase line**, or since the step started before
  the first, so a 28-minute phase does not read like a 2-minute one.
- **Gates:** one line for the node, studio and sd-filter checks, or one per failure, then each cargo
  command's start and end.
- **At run start:** every plan still parked, with its age and the worktree it holds, or the branch
  `resume` reopens it from when the worktree is gone.
- **Also:** a lane opening, a park, a close, a fast-forward.

The same lines go to `state/live.log`, under one header per run. They are a display, read from the
CLI's stream: an event kind the reader does not know prints nothing, so a missing line is never
evidence that something did not happen.

**A lane waits when opening its next plan would exceed `max_open_worktrees`**, and the digest's **Now**
names the plan it waits to start and the plans that hold the worktrees. A slot frees when a holder
merges, resumes itself to a merge, or when you remove a parked plan's lane by hand. Under
`--until-idle` the lane waits only while a holder is in flight in the run, and otherwise stops and
says so, as before. **The cap counts worktree directories that exist on disk**, so a lane you removed
with `git worktree remove` stops counting at once, whatever `state/conductor.json` says.

**An idle lane watches.** With nothing to start, a lane of a resident run sleeps a minute and looks
again: `queue.json` from the main checkout, the plan files, and any `resume` you asked for meanwhile.
A plan approved and queued while the run is up starts within the minute. A `queue.json` that no longer
validates is not taken; the run keeps the queue it had and prints why once. **`claude --version` is
read again before every session**, so an update installed mid-run is judged before it runs anything:
a patch above a verified version runs with the warning, and any other unverified version parks the
plan about to start `cli_contract` and pauses the run.

## What to read afterwards

- **`tools/conductor/digest.md`** is the **current state**, in two sections and nothing else
  (ADR-0214):
  - **Needs you** — the whole worklist, first, so that a page whose first section is empty means
    nothing is waiting on you. It opens with a one-line count and then lists, in this order: the
    CLI-version warning when the last run carried one; every standing park with its age, the worktree
    it holds (or the branch `resume` reopens it from), the usage reading its session ended on and its
    resume command; every lane stopped at the worktree cap, naming what holds the slots; every lane
    still on disk after a merge; and every merge's open findings with their `file:line`.

    A finding leaves that list when the close repaired it (`fixed_in`) or when you closed it with
    `finding NNNN <ref> --done|--wontfix|--filed <reason>` (ADR-0216). **One line then counts every
    finding you have closed**, and names the two commands that read them back — never a per-plan
    breakdown, which is the same accumulation one indent further in. The count line is left out at
    zero, and the section's opening count is of **open** findings only, so a page with nothing on it
    is one line.

    **Already settled, clear the record** closes that section: a park the repository itself shows as
    finished, counted apart from the live ones and never listed among them. Two conditions decide it,
    both narrow, both read from the tree, and **nothing else — never an age, never a branch's commits,
    never a tag**: the plan is under `docs/plans/done/` **in the main checkout** with `Status: done`
    (a close that landed outside the conductor never touches `state/conductor.json`), or a
    `human_phase` / `claude_dir` park sits on a phase the plan's own `## Implementation log` now marks
    `done`, **or** `owed` on a phase marked `Blocks merge: no` — read in the lane when the worktree is
    still there, in the main checkout when it is gone. A close committed in a lane that has not
    merged is **not** settled. `status` prints the same verdict on the same park, and both ask the one
    reader a self-resume asks, `settledPhase` in `lib/plan.mjs`. **The digest writes nothing back**: `resume NNNN` clears the record, and
    it stays your explicit act.
  - **Now** — per lane, the plan, the step and how long it has been in it, and what the plan has
    spent. When no run is live, the last run's end time and its one-line totals.

  It is gitignored and rewritten from `state/` and `git` after every step, so deleting it loses
  nothing. Nothing on it is per-run: **what last night produced is `digest --history`**, or the
  closed plan's own committed `## Close review`.
- **`tools/conductor/digest-history.md`** is the per-run account, written only by
  `conductor.mjs digest --history`, newest run first:
  - **Needs you:** every park in that run with its resume command and the usage reading its session
    ended on, every lane that stopped at the worktree cap, then every merge's open findings with
    their `file:line`. The newest run adds **Still parked from an earlier run**: each plan still
    parked from before it, with its age, the worktree it holds (or the branch `resume` reopens it
    from) and its resume command.
  - **Not started:** each queued plan the run did not open, with why: `worktree cap`, `--once`, or
    `after NNNN (parked)` naming the plan it waits on and that plan's status. Left out when the run
    opened everything it could.
  - **Closed:** each merged plan's tag, merge commit, fix rounds, active time (its steps and gates)
    and wall time within the run it merged in, **both** what it spent in that run and what it has
    spent over its whole life, and every review finding exactly as the reviewer emitted it. The two
    `$` figures are named because a run-scoped time beside a lifetime spend reads as neither; the
    per-run one is what Totals below sums. A finding you have closed carries its verb, its reason and
    the date here, whatever the current page counts: this is the record of the judgement.
  - **Failed and parked:** gate reds with the failing tests, disagreements, spend-cap hits, session
    errors.
  - **Totals:** merged and parked counts, spend, time spent waiting on each lock, the 5-hour and
    7-day usage windows at run start and run end, and gate minutes split into the full suite and
    everything else, with the count of suite runs skipped.

  It is gitignored too, and both pages are built from one reader over `state/conductor.json`.
- **`state/live.log`** holds every line the run terminal printed, one header per run, for a run you
  did not watch.
- **`## Close review` in each closed plan** holds the review itself, committed with the close.
- **`state/inbox.md`** gets one entry per park: the reason, the file to read, the worktree it holds,
  and the resume command. A park the run cleared itself gets an entry too, naming the condition that
  settled it, so the inbox is a log as well as a worklist; the digest is the page to read first.
- **`state/`** holds everything else: `conductor.json` (the runtime record), `transcripts/` (every
  session's stream), `prompts/`, `reviews/`, `gates/` (each gate command's output), `locks.jsonl`
  and `live.log`.

## Acting on a park

**Five reasons resume themselves** inside a live run, once the tree shows them settled (ADR-0250):
`human_phase` and `claude_dir` once the phase's log row reads `done`, or `owed` on a human phase
marked `Blocks merge: no` (in the lane, or on `main` when the lane is gone), `usage_limit` once the reset it recorded has passed, `main_dirty` once the main
checkout is on `main` and clean, and `studio_install` an hour after it failed, three times at most.
**None of them resumes over a dirty worktree.** Each self-resume prints a line and writes an inbox
entry. Every other reason is yours: `resume` it once you have acted.

| Reason | What to do before `resume` |
|---|---|
| `human_phase` | Do the phase. Mark its row `done` in the plan's `## Implementation log` **in the lane** (`WORK/rlx-plan-NNNN`) and commit it there. `resume` checks the row, and a live run resumes it by itself. A phase marked `Blocks merge: no` settles with an `owed` row and does not need `done`; the conductor writes that row itself when it reaches the phase, so only a park from before the marker was added needs it written by hand: see below. |
| `claude_dir` | The same, and for the same reason: the phase declares a file under `.claude/`, which the CLI will not let a session write (ADR-0210). **Nothing was run** — the park comes before the phase. The detail names the paths. Do the phase in the lane, mark its row `done`, commit; `resume` checks the row. |
| `studio_install` | The plan declares files under `studio/` and `npm --prefix studio ci` failed, so the gate's three studio checks could not run (ADR-0218). The detail carries the install's tail; the usual cause is no network. **Nothing was run** — the park comes before the first session. Install by hand in the lane, or wait and `resume`, which installs again: the trigger is a missing `studio/node_modules`, so the open lane the park left behind is installed into rather than skipped. |
| `stop_condition`, `plan_wrong`, `question` | Read the transcript the inbox names. Settle it in a human-started `/architect` session. A `plan_wrong` from the readiness check names the phase and the contradiction, and nothing was implemented: edit the plan, or resume to overrule it. |
| `gate_red` | The gate was red, a repair session ran, and the re-run was red too; or the plan had already run its three repairs. The park reads the second run's log. Fix the defect in the lane. |
| `review_failed` | Read the last review under `state/reviews/`. Resuming grants two fresh fix rounds. |
| `disagreement` | A session's claim and `git` differ. Read the detail and the transcript before trusting the lane. |
| `cli_contract` | The CLI ran a session without the project hooks, or without loading the skill it invoked. Read the detail and the transcript, then verify the CLI version before resuming (`## When the CLI updates`). |
| `lost_background` | The session started a command in the background and ended with it unfinished, so that work was killed with the session. Its commits are still in the lane. Read the detail for the command, check what the lane actually contains, then resume: the step runs again from what the plan log and `git` show. |
| `usage_limit` | The account's usage limit ended a session, and the conductor did not wait it out, because the reset was more than 6 h away (the seven-day window), the CLI reported none, or the step had already been continued three times. The detail says which. The session's half-done work is still in the lane, uncommitted, so `resume` refuses it until you commit or `git restore` it. Resuming then re-runs the step from what the plan log and `git` show. |
| `budget`, `api`, `no_outcome`, `bad_outcome` | Raise the budget in `local.json`, or read the transcript. Resuming re-runs the step from what the plan log and `git` show. |
| `merge_conflict` | A merge session could not resolve a conflict and parked it, or the close hit one in code. Resolve it in the lane and commit the merge; a resumed plan goes straight back to where it stopped. |
| `merge_failed`, `main_dirty` | Clean the main checkout, or clear what refused the fast-forward. `main_dirty` resumes itself once the main checkout is on `main` and clean. |

**A readiness check reads the plan before any spend** (ADR-0248). Before a plan's first implement
session, a fresh read-only `architect` session checks that each phase's *What*, *Files touched* and
*Done when* agree with each other and with the tree, that every done-when is runnable under the
allowlist, and that no phase reads a `Blocks merge: no` phase's output. It ends `ready`, or parks
`plan_wrong` naming the phase before any implementer runs. The conductor checks it left `HEAD` and the
tree untouched. A `ready` is recorded against a hash of the plan's text above `## Implementation log`,
so it runs again on resume only when a phase changed; a readiness park is never recorded as passing,
so resuming one runs it again. The budget is `budget_usd.readiness`, required.

**A red gate gets one repair session, not a park** (ADR-0248). At any stage, a red starts a fresh
`dev` session, or a `studio-builder` one when the failing command is a studio check, handed the
failing command and its gate log. It commits a fix, and the stage's gate runs again; a second red at
that stage parks `gate_red`, reading the second run's log. A plan runs three repairs at most, and a
red after that parks with no session. The repair prompt forbids changing an assertion, a golden or a
test's inputs to make it pass: a test the session thinks is wrong parks `plan_wrong`. **A repair at
`post-close` or `remerge` reaches `main` without a review**, since the close already graded the plan:
the conductor moves the annotated tag onto the repaired tip, and the digest's **Needs you** names each
such commit by SHA until `origin/main` holds it. Read those before you push. The budget is
`budget_usd.repair`, required.

**A red `origin/main` is reported at every close and never stops one** (ADR-0251). With the close lock
held and before the close session starts, the lane runs `scripts/check-upstream-ci.mjs`'s reader
against the main checkout's `origin`: the newest completed run of the `CI` workflow on `main`, through
`gh`. `Pages` and `Release` runs are never read, and a cancelled run is passed over. Whatever it reads,
the close goes ahead. The conductor never pushes, so `origin/main` moves only when you push, and a
close that waited on it would wait on a step no session can take; there is no park reason for it.

- **Red:** the live log gets one line, `upstream CI: RED - run <id> at <sha> concluded failure, failing
  <jobs>; closing anyway`, and the digest's **Needs you** carries a line naming the run and the
  failing jobs. That line stays until a later close reads `origin/main` green; an unread reading in
  between does not clear it. Repair `main` and push.
- **Unread**, because there is no `origin`, no `gh`, an unauthenticated `gh` or no network: the live
  log gets `upstream CI: skipped: not read (<case>)`. A machine without `gh auth login` therefore
  closes as before, and the live log shows that nothing was read.

Every reading, green, red or unread, is kept on the plan's record as `upstream`.

**A merge that conflicts gets one merge session, not a park** (ADR-0248). The lane merges `main` itself
before the `pre-review` gate, so the gate and the review see the tree that will reach `main`, and it
merges again before the fast-forward when `main` moved meanwhile. A conflict at either point is
aborted and handed to a fresh `dev` session, or a `studio-builder` one when every conflicted path is
under `studio/`, which redoes the merge, resolves it and commits. The conductor then checks the
result: a merge commit whose second parent is `main`, a clean tree, and no conflict marker in the
paths it handed over. The gate runs next as usual. Each conflict gets its own session, and a merge
session that cannot resolve one parks `merge_conflict`. Its budget is `budget_usd.merge` in
`local.json`, which is required.

**A `human` phase marked `Blocks merge: no` is owed, not waited for** (ADR-0249). The conductor
commits its log row as `owed` in the lane, runs the phases after it, reviews, closes and merges as
though it were not there. The digest's **Needs you** then carries one line per owed phase, read from
every plan under `docs/plans/done/` in the main checkout, so it survives a wiped `state/`. Do the phase
when you can, mark its row `done` in the closed plan **on `main`**, and commit: the line leaves with
the commit, and no command records it. A phase that finds a problem does not reopen its plan; the
finding becomes a backlog entry or a new plan. The field on a `dev` or `studio-builder` phase is a
plan error `check` reports.

**A usage limit is waited out, not parked.** When the account's limit ends a session (a 429 with a
`rejected` rate-limit reading), the lane sleeps until the window reopens, plus two minutes, and then
continues **the same session** with `claude -p --resume <session_id>`, so its context and its
uncommitted work carry on. The run terminal prints `usage  limit reached; waiting N min, until HH:MM
UTC`, and `status` and the digest's **Now** show the lane waiting. A step is continued at most three
times, and a reset more than 6 h away parks `usage_limit` instead. The transcripts are
`<step>.jsonl`, then `<step>-resume-1.jsonl` and so on. The step's spend is the last invocation's
figure, because the CLI reports a continued session's cost cumulatively (`spike/README.md`).
`abort` during the wait works as always: the step runs again from scratch on the next `run`.

**A suite you run by hand counts.** Run one through the wrapper —
`node tools/conductor/with-lock.mjs suite -- cargo nextest run --workspace` — and, because the
wrapper can see it is running inside this repository or one of its worktrees, it records the result in
`state/suite-ledger.jsonl` as `hand`. The conductor's next gate on that same tree finds the record,
prints it and does not run the suite again (ADR-0207). The clean-at-both-ends rule is the same as for
a session's run: a tree that was dirty when the suite started or when it finished records nothing,
because the tree hash would not name what was tested. `RLX_SUITE_LEDGER` still overrides the choice,
and a wrapped run in any other repository records nothing.

**There is one ledger per repository, not one per worktree.** The park table sends you *into a lane*
for every reason it lists, so the wrapper you reach for there is usually the lane's own copy of it —
and the file it writes has to be the one the gate reads. The wrapper therefore resolves
`state/suite-ledger.jsonl` under its counterpart in the **main checkout**, found through the
repository's common git directory, whichever worktree it was invoked from. A repository whose main
checkout cannot be derived — a bare clone, or a `.git` relocated away from its tree — records beside
the invoked script as before, and says so in one line on stderr.

**The review and the close are two sessions, and a clean verdict outlives a park** (ADR-0248). The
review ends on its verdict and commits nothing, with no lock held, so two lanes' reviews run at once.
A clean verdict is recorded with the tip it graded; the conductor then takes the close lock and starts
the close, handed the review's path. A close that parks — a red gate, a wrong plan — keeps that
verdict: `resume` starts a close again, not a review, as long as every commit the lane gained since the
graded tip is a merge of `main` or a commit a close, merge or repair session made. **Any other commit,
your own hand fix included, runs a fresh review round**, because nothing has reviewed it. A close that
meets a conflict in code parks it back to the conductor, which runs a merge session and starts the
close again. The close's budget is `budget_usd.close`, required.

**A close that landed without an outcome is adopted, never closed a second time.** A close session
commits its repairs, its `done/` move, its version bump and its tag before it prints anything, so a
session that dies after that leaves the branch closed and the record open. Before a run reviews
anything it asks the **branch**: a plan under `done/` with `Status: done` and a `## Close review` is a
finished close. It is verified exactly as a session's own close is — clean tree, annotated tag on the
tip — and then recorded, so the run goes straight to the gate on the close tip and the fast-forward.
A branch that does not verify parks `disagreement` and names why; nothing is recorded, and no second
version or tag is ever written. `adopt-close NNNN` does the same thing on demand, for a record that
needs repairing outside a run: it changes nothing unless the branch verifies, and `resume` then `run`
finishes the plan.

**Whatever the reason, `resume` refuses a lane whose worktree is dirty.** A session is told to leave
the tree clean and may run `git restore` to do it, but a park does not prove that it did. The park
records the dirty paths: the first 10 and a count of the rest, in `conductor.json`, the inbox entry
and the digest's **Needs you** line. The conductor never reverts them, because they may be the
evidence you need, such as the goldens a test run re-encoded. Read them, then commit them or
`git restore` them in the lane, and resume.

A merged plan whose worktree could not be removed (Windows refuses while any shell sits inside it) is
an inbox entry, not a park: close the shell, then `git worktree remove`, `git worktree prune` and
`git branch -d`.

## Closing a finding

A close review's `minor` and `nit` findings that the close did not repair are yours (ADR-0209), and
they stay on the digest until you say what became of one. An open finding has three honest futures,
and `finding` records which (ADR-0216):

```text
node tools/conductor/conductor.mjs finding 0181
node tools/conductor/conductor.mjs finding 0181 3 --wontfix "assertion message, no reader"
```

- **`--done`** — you repaired it. **`--wontfix`** — you judged it not worth repairing. **`--filed`** —
  it is now a `docs/design-backlog.md` entry, which carries its own probe. Writing that entry stays
  yours; the verb only records that someone did.
- **The reason is required**, and an empty or whitespace one is refused. Nothing verifies a
  disposition — unlike `fixed_in`, which is a commit the conductor checks against the branch, this is
  a judgement checked against nothing — so the sentence you type is the whole record of it.
- **`<ref>` is the index the listing prints**, or the `file:line` exactly one finding carries. A ref
  that matches nothing, or more than one, is refused naming what it saw.
- **Only a closed plan has findings.** A plan still in a fix round, or parked at one, carries verdicts
  that closed nothing — its blockers are the conductor's own work in flight — so `finding` refuses it
  either way and names where the plan stands.
- **Re-dispositioning overwrites and keeps the previous one** in the finding's history: a `--wontfix`
  you later repair should read as repaired, and that you first declined it is worth keeping.
- **Only you write one.** No session, no close and no gate may, and *recording* one is refused while
  a conductor is live, because that run would write its own copy of the record over yours; listing is
  read-only and runs at any time.

The dispositions live in `state/conductor.json`, which is gitignored: losing that file returns every
closed finding to the page. The finding *text* is safe — it is committed in each plan's
`## Close review` — but the judgement about it is not.

## How it stays safe

- **The sessions.** Each one runs with `--permission-mode dontAsk` and the allowlist in
  `settings.conductor.json`, with `RLX_CONDUCTOR=1` in its environment. It gets one of the
  `prompts/` templates as its appended system prompt, and that prompt is the only thing that puts a
  skill into its `## Conductor mode`.
- **The allowlist covers a phase's own scratch work, and the bound on a deletion is the text of its
  path.** Making and removing a file or directory, `cat` / `Get-Content`, and `git clean` /
  `git checkout` of a path named after `--` all run. An `rm` or `Remove-Item` is denied when its
  command carries `..`, `~`, an argument starting with `/` in any position, quoted or not, a drive
  letter or a `$`,
  and an `rm` also when it carries a backtick. That covers a path a session writes out and a path the
  shell would expand (`$HOME`, `${HOME}`, `$(...)`, a backtick).
  What runs is a deletion spelled as a plain relative path, such as `rm -rf target/debug`.
  **The bound reads text, not the filesystem**: a relative path through a symlink inside the lane is
  not seen, and a legitimate `rm -rf "$SCRATCH"` is refused along with the rest. A `git clean` with no
  path matches nothing. `git checkout` reaches nothing but a path, because a rule without the `--`
  would let a session move the lane's branch, and `git stash` is refused outright: that stack is
  shared by every worktree on the machine. A `cd` is covered by no allow rule, so
  `cd studio; npm run typecheck` is refused for its `cd`, and the prompts tell a session to run one
  command per call and pass `--prefix` instead. **What is measured and what is modelled:** the `rm`
  literal escapes (`..`, `~`, a leading `/`, a drive letter), the `rm` expansion shapes and the `cd`
  were observed on the real CLI (2.1.282, the table in `spike/README.md`, produced by
  `spike/matcher-probe.mjs`). The rest is modelled: an absolute path after the first argument, a
  quoted absolute path, the
  `git stash`, `git checkout` and `git clean` refusals, and the PowerShell `Remove-Item` rules, which
  only a Windows run can ask. **Every rule has a case in `test/settings.test.mjs`**, which fails on a rule added without one;
  a refusal the probe recorded is asserted against that table and against a model of the file, so a
  deny rule deleted since the probe turns it red, and everything else against the model alone.
- **Writing is bounded too, by path** (ADR-0255). `Write` and `Edit` are granted only as
  `./**` (the session's working directory, which is its lane), `//tmp/**` (the OS temp directory on
  Linux) and `/state/reviews/**` (resolved against this settings file's own directory, so it names
  `tools/conductor/state/reviews/`, where a review or close session writes its review). A write
  anywhere else is refused by dontAsk. `--add-dir` grants nothing on its own: the reviews rule is what
  lets a review write there. All of this was observed on 2.1.283 (the write table in
  `spike/README.md`, from `spike/matcher-probe.mjs --writes`), and `test/settings.test.mjs` holds the
  grants to exactly the spellings that table names. **Linux only so far:** `//tmp/**` is not the
  Windows or macOS temp directory, and no probe has run there.
- **A command is admitted when the session already holds that capability through `Read`, `Glob`,
  `Grep` or `Write`, and refused otherwise.** Admitting such a command buys turns, not power: a
  session denied `ls` lists the directory with `Glob` on its next turn. So `ls`, `printenv`, `grep` and
  `sed -n` run. `cp` and `mv` stay refused, because `Write` is the reviewed path for creating a file
  and a shell copy is how a session sidesteps it; `gh` stays refused, because it reaches the network
  and authenticates as the owner. `sed -n` also carries sed's `e` and `w` commands, so, like the
  `node *` rule already allowed, it is not a boundary; the refusals of `cp`, `mv` and `gh` steer a
  session to the reviewed tool, they do not fence it. The roster grows from denials a session actually hit, never from
  imagination, so a command no session was refused gets no entry.
- **An environment variable ahead of a command is allowed by name, never by shape.** A rule for
  `VAR=value <allowed command>` would admit every variable there is, including the ones that change
  what a build produces, so the allowlist instead lists the ones this project documents:
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS` for `cargo doc`, and `RLX_UPDATE_PRESET_SCHEMA=1` / `RLX_UPDATE_PARAM_REFERENCE=1`
  for the two regenerations in `docs/developing.md` and `presets/README.md`, which are the commands a
  session runs unchanged. Each of those two is allowed both bare and in front of `with-lock.mjs`,
  because the suite-lock hook denies the bare form of anything that runs tests. Adding a third
  variable is an edit to this file and a case beside the others, deliberately. The other shell spells
  an assignment as its own command (`$env:X = '1'; …`), which stays refused; the prompts tell a
  session so.
- **The hooks.** `.claude/hooks/block-push-and-history-rewrite.js` denies `git push`,
  `reset --hard`, `rebase`, `commit --amend` and `filter-branch` in every session, human-started
  ones included. `.claude/hooks/conductor-suite-lock.js` denies any `nextest` or `cargo test` a
  conductor session runs outside the lock, except `cargo nextest list`, which runs no test and
  takes no lock even when wrapped. `.claude/hooks/conductor-no-background.js` denies
  `run_in_background` on a shell call.
- **No session writes under `.claude/`, and nothing pretends otherwise.** The CLI denies a headless
  session an `Edit` or a `Write` there whatever the allowlist says — measured on 2.1.273 (Windows) and 2.1.278, 2.1.280 and 2.1.282 (Linux) under both
  `settings.conductor.json` and settings naming `.claude/` paths explicitly, while a read is allowed
  and a write elsewhere in the same worktree succeeds (`spike/README.md`). So **a phase whose
  `Files touched` names such a path parks the plan before the phase runs**, `claude_dir`, with the
  paths as the detail; the phases before it in the same run are still handed to a session. A review
  **finding** under `.claude/` stays open, carries no `fixed_in`, and names its replacement text in
  the digest's **Needs you**, for the owner to apply. ADR-0210; it amends ADR-0209's repair list.
- **No session works in the background.** Nothing re-invokes a `claude -p` session: one that starts
  a long command in the background and ends its turn exits, the command is killed, and the result is
  lost — after the commits it already made have landed. Three layers, none sufficient alone: the
  `prompts/` and each skill's `## Conductor mode` say so, the hook above and the settings' `Monitor`
  denial refuse it, and a session that reaches its result with a background command still unfinished
  parks the plan `lost_background` before its outcome is read. The detector reads a result-text shape
  the CLI owns, so a reworded message would stop it seeing a start — which is why the other two
  layers exist.
- **The suite's three tiers never skip a test outright** (ADR-0211). The gate's suite step is
  `skipped` when a green record names **this exact tree** and nothing runs; `served` when a green
  record names some other tree and every path between the two is on a declared list, and then
  `cargo nextest run --workspace -P fast` runs in the full suite's place; `ran` otherwise, the full
  suite. **The only question the tier ever answers is *full suite or `-P fast`*, and `-P fast` is
  what CI runs on every push** — `hygiene.rs`, `preset.rs`, every `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` reader and
  ADR-0157's 24-preset sample are inside it. What a served tree trades away is the nine deferred GPU
  suites' sweep, on a diff that cannot reach them.
- **The served list is an allowlist, and the direction is the safety surface.** `SERVED_PATHS` in
  `lib/ledger.mjs` is the list: `docs/`, `.claude/`, `tools/`, `site/`, `studio/`, `packaging/`,
  `renders/`, any `*.md`, and `Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock` when their whole diff is a
  `version = "x.y.z"` line. A path is served only by being **named**; everything unlisted — every
  `.rs`, every `.wgsl`, `presets/*.toml`, `core/tests/goldens/`, `.config/nextest.toml`,
  `.github/` — falls through to the full suite by omission. Written the other way round, a path type
  nobody thought of would be under-gated silently; an allowlist that forgets a path is merely slow.
  The diff is measured **against the green tree**, not against the stage's own commits, so a
  `git merge main` that brought in another lane's render change re-arms the suite by construction.
- **A served run never becomes a green record.** Its ledger line carries `served: true` and a `cmd`
  that is not the one the key names, so neither lookup can read it back: the next stage leans on the
  full-suite record again, and one `-P fast` never chains off another. The run terminal prints a
  served step's own line naming the tier and the tree it leaned on, and the history's Totals counts
  served runs apart from full ones.
- **The locks.** `with-lock.mjs` holds two machine-wide locks. The **suite** lock stops two lanes
  running the GPU suites at once. The **close** lock runs from before the close session until `main` has
  fast-forwarded, so a version bump and its tag always land on the `main` they were computed against.
  It is never held over a review (ADR-0248).
- **The checks.** The conductor believes the repository, not the session. A claimed commit must
  exist and be new, the plan's log rows must match, the tree must be clean, and a close must leave
  the plan under `done/` with a `## Close review` and an annotated tag on the branch tip. A finding
  the close marks repaired (`fixed_in`, ADR-0209) must name a commit on the branch that changes that
  finding's file, under the path the finding names or the path it had at that commit, following
  every rename git pairs between the commit and the tip and, whatever the similarity, the plan's own
  move to `done/`.

## The gate

The conductor runs its own gate in the worktree and ignores any session's claim that the checks
passed. **What runs at each stage is `gateForStage` in `lib/gate.mjs`, and nowhere else**: read it
there rather than from a copy here, which would drift. The commands run in order and stop at the
first red. The gate runs at four stages: `pre-review` after the last implementer run and the lane's
merge of `main`, `fix-N` after
each fix round, `post-close` on the tip a close produced before `main` moves, and `remerge` after the
automatic re-merge of a moved `main`. Only the last two run a step marked `afterClose`. **A full
workspace suite the conductor saw pass is not run again on the same tree** (ADR-0207), and **a tree
a green record serves runs `-P fast` in its place rather than the full suite** (ADR-0211 — the three
tiers, and the list they rest on, are in *How it stays safe* above).
`state/suite-ledger.jsonl` holds one line per suite run that conductor code observed, keyed by
`HEAD^{tree}` and written only when the worktree was clean at both ends, plus one line per skip
naming the run it relied on and one per served run naming the tree it leaned on and the diff that
served. The gate and `with-lock.mjs` both consult it: every session is handed
the ledger in `RLX_SUITE_LEDGER`. They skip on a green record for the exact tree and print that
record, and the digest counts every skip. **Only the gate serves a record forward**: a session's
wrapped suite keeps the exact-tree lookup, so the lanes' `## Conductor mode` instructions stay true
as written. Any change to a tracked file, a doc included, is a new
tree. A red run is recorded and never skipped on. Any argument vector other than the ledger's own
(`SUITE_COMMAND` in `lib/ledger.mjs`) neither skips nor records, and outside the conductor the
wrapper never reads the ledger.

**A step it skips says so, and the lane makes the studio's precondition true** (ADR-0218). A step
guarded on a path (`studio/node_modules`) or on a command (`python3`) used to drop out with nothing
recorded, so the only evidence was a step count nobody had a number to compare against — and since
`studio/node_modules` is gitignored and `git worktree add` never creates one, **every lane had ever
run its gate with the studio's typecheck, lint and tests skipped**. Now the skip reaches the run
terminal and the gate's own result, in the pre-push hook's shape: the step, what is missing, and the
command that would make it run. And a lane whose plan **declares** files under `studio/` runs
`npm --prefix studio ci` before its first session, so those three are real for it; an install that
fails parks the plan `studio_install` before any session starts. A plan that does not name `studio/`
gets no install and the announced skip. **The trigger is a missing `studio/node_modules`, not the
open** — a failed install leaves the worktree behind, so a `resume` walks back into an open lane and
installs there; a lane that already has its dependencies is never reinstalled, because `npm ci`
deletes `node_modules` before it writes one.

**The backlog probes wait for the close.** A plan can deliver exactly what a live entry's probe says
is missing, and turn that probe red. Archiving the entry is the close's job (ADR-0108), so a red
probe before the review is not a defect yet. `post-close` still parks a close that left one red.

## When the CLI updates

`VERIFIED_CLI` in `conductor.mjs` lists the `claude --version`s the evidence in `spike/README.md` was
produced on (ADR-0208). The readings through 2.1.273 were taken on Windows 10 with Node 22. The 2.1.278,
2.1.280 and 2.1.282 readings were taken on Arch Linux with Node 26, and they are the only ones that
cover Linux. A version
verified on one platform only has not been checked on the other, so re-run the probe on the platform
the conductor will run on.

- **A higher patch of a listed major.minor runs, with a warning.** `run` and `check` print it, the run
  records it as `cli`, and the digest's **Needs you** carries it while that run is the latest one.
  The line stops appearing on the first run whose version is listed; the history keeps it on the run
  that carried it. This CLI numbers nearly every release as a patch, so in
  practice most updates land here.
- **Any other unlisted version is refused**, as before: a new minor or major, or a lower patch.

**Every session proves the project hooks ran in it, whatever the version.** The conductor hands each
step a hook log, `state/hooks/<step>.log`. `.claude/hooks/conductor-suite-lock.js` appends one line to it
per shell call. When a session ends, before its outcome is read, two things must hold. If its
transcript holds a `Bash` or `PowerShell` call, the hook log must be non-empty. The stream's
`system/init` must list the skill the prompt invoked. Either failure parks the plan `cli_contract`.
It proves that one hook ran, not that every one did, and a session with no shell call cannot be
checked.

To verify a new version, and clear the warning:

1. Run `node tools/conductor/spike/probe.mjs` (two short sessions on `--model haiku`).
2. Compare its output with the evidence table in `spike/README.md`.
3. Record the new version there, then add it to the list.

## Tests

```sh
node --test "tools/conductor/test/*.test.mjs"
```

No test spends money or needs a network. `test/fake-claude.mjs` stands in for the CLI, and
`test/lane-scenario.mjs` makes the commits a real session would, in throwaway repositories. CI's
`links` job runs the same command.
