// The lane state machine (ADR-0205). Per plan:
//
//   open the lane, and install its dependencies whenever `node_modules/` is absent, since no
//   worktree is born with one and every gate step needs it
//   -> before the first implement session of each pick: merge main into the lane (`pre-readiness`,
//      a conflict handed to one merge session), then one read-only readiness session unless the
//      plan's readiness record matches both its contract and the main tip just merged (ADR-0016)
//   -> for each same-owner run not done: one implement session, then verify its claim
//   -> a `human` phase parks, unless it is marked `Blocks merge: no`, when its row is committed
//      `owed` and the plan runs on without it (ADR-0249)
//   -> merge main into the lane, a conflict handed to one merge session (ADR-0248)
//   -> conductor gate -> review session, no lock held, ending on a verdict
//      (every gate red gets one repair session and one re-run before it parks `gate_red`, ADR-0248)
//   -> blockers/majors: fix session, verify, gate, re-review (two fix rounds max)
//   -> clean: take the close lock -> close session -> verify the close -> gate the close tip
//      -> fast-forward main (one automatic re-merge)
//   -> release the lock
//   -> remove the lane.
//
// Every judgement the loop cannot make parks the plan: the plan keeps its worktree and branch, the
// inbox gains an entry, and the lane moves to the next queued plan whose `after` list has merged.
// The repository, not the session, is the evidence at every step (close.mjs).
//
// A resident run (ADR-0250) never ends on an empty lane: the lane looks again every IDLE_POLL_MS,
// re-reading the queue, and on every look clears the parks of a closed list whose condition the tree
// now shows settled. The worktree cap is a wait. `pause`, a spent `run_budget_usd` or a refused CLI
// version ends it the way ADR-0219's pause does: the plan in flight finishes and no other starts.
