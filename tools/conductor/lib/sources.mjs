// Whether a running conductor is still executing the code on disk.
//
// `run` is one long-lived Node process that imports its modules once, so a change to them merged
// while it is up does not reach it: it keeps deciding with the logic it started with. At start the run
// records a content hash of its module set in state/conductor.sources.json beside its pid; the run
// compares it against the files on each look and pauses when they differ, and `status`, `resume` and
// `park` compare it too and say so, since the live run is what acts on their asks.
//
// Content, never a timestamp: a checkout that rewrites a file with identical bytes is not a change.
// Nothing here restarts the run or stops a session: an in-flight session killed mid-plan loses its
// work, which is the harm ADR-0205 refuses for backgrounded commands.
