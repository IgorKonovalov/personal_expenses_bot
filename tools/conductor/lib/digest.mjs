// tools/conductor/digest.md: what is happening, and where you are needed (ADR-0214).
//
// Two renderers over one state reader. `renderDigest` is the current-state page, rewritten after
// every step: **Needs you** — the whole worklist — then **Now**, what each lane is doing this minute.
// `renderHistory` is the per-run account `conductor.mjs digest --history` writes beside it in
// digest-history.md: newest run first, each run's Needs you, Still parked from an earlier run (the
// newest run only), Not started, Closed, Failed and parked, Totals. Both build from
// `readDigestState` and neither reaches past it: a second traversal of state/conductor.json is where
// the two pages would drift.
//
// Generated from state/ and git only — never written by hand, never inside a worktree — so neither
// page carries a generation timestamp. The current page's park ages and a live lane's elapsed time
// are the one reading of the clock, taken from the reader's `now`; with no run live and nothing
// parked, either page regenerated from the same state yields the same bytes.
//
// Time in the history is always time within one run: a plan's active time is its steps' and gates'
// own durations, never a span across a park. A finding line copies the verdict outcome the reviewer
// emitted — severity, file:line, what — plus whatever the record says has become of it, and nothing
// else; neither page summarizes review prose. An event (a step, a park, a merge) belongs to the
// latest run that had started by the event's timestamp.
